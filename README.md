# Building Footprints from NOAA ERI 

The goal is to extract building frootprints from (NOAA emergency response imagery)[storms.ngs.noaa.gov/]. This imagery is near-nadir and off nadir, so the first attempt will be using routines developed for the (SpaceNet 4 Challenge)[https://spacenet.ai/off-nadir-building-detection/]. 

We are currently working on implementing first model from SN4, the (Baseline Model)[https://github.com/CosmiQ/CosmiQ_SN4_Baseline]

For downloading NOAA imagery, we suggest (`psi-collect`)[https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/psi-collect]
